USE:
Program converts a binary file into an ASCII text file.  This enables the user 
to view a file in binary with notepad.  Instead of seeing a garbled ASCII 
interpretation of the file, the user will see a file consisting of an 
arbitrary number of ones and zeros split into byte sized chunks. To convert 
input type './bin2txt < input_file_name

BUILDING
To build the source type 'make' on the command line. This program was built 
in Linux using GCC. Other compilers should also work, but it has not been 
tested.
